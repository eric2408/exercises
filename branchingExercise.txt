git checkout -b
Fast-forward occurs when the two branches that have the same previous commits because original branch hasn't changed.
On the other hand, recursive merge occurs when original branch and the other branch made changes. Thus, making the previous commits different.
git checkout
git branch -D
Merge conflicts occur when Git can't choose which file to pick while merging because there has been different commits in different branches.
